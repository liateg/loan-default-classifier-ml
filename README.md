#  Loan Default Classifier – Machine Learning Project

Predict whether a loan applicant will default using logistic regression, based on financial and personal data.  
Built as part of my hands-on learning journey through the **Machine Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

##  Project Summary

This project tackles a **binary classification** problem to predict loan defaults.  
It includes the full ML pipeline from data analysis to model evaluation and is designed to reinforce key machine learning concepts:

- Logistic Regression
- Feature Engineering
- Regularization
- Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, ROC–AUC)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Loan Default Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default)  
- Contains information about customers including income, loan amount, credit history, and more
- Target Variable: `default` (0 = no default, 1 = default)

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
